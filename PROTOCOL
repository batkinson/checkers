# Checkers Network Protocol

The following describes the essential elements of the checkers protocol. Clients
send commands (CMD) and servers send status messages (STATUS) and command
results (RESULT). Status messages can be received independent of a client
issuing a command, such as when the turn changes, a move is made, a piece is
captured or kinged, or the game is won. Results are only received after a
command is issued, but relevant status messages are expected to be sent before
an OK response.  The protocol is designed such that the game state can be
determined by the initial game state plus the stream of status updates.
Messages are terminated by newlines. Tokens are separated by spaces.
