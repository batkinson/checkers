# Checkers

It's just what it sounds like: a simple checkers game. I started this project
with a fellow Hacker School attendee to explore and gain experience with pygame
and python software development tools like nosetest and travis-ci.

## Requirements

To run this program, you'll need:

  * A working Python 2 environment
  * PyGame

## Setup

To run the program, you just need to install the dependencies. This should be
as simple as running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

However, you likely will not be able to install pygame through pip. Under Ubuntu
you should just be able to install pygame through apt:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
Then you can re-run the pip install command above to complete the installation.

## Running

Simply run checkers.py like so:
 
```
cd $CHECKERS_HOME/checkers
python checkers.py
```
